Automate the creation of C++ projects.

This powershell script creates a C++ project with boilerplate files and directories to allow me to go straight into coding. It is setup for my own personal project use cases and may not be suitable for you.

## Requirements

The script requires a drive at `w:\` where it will install the script.

## One line installation
